B-5 then committed a flag guarding penalty in his own end zone.\nIf Team B declines the illegal forward pass penalty by Team A, then Team B has committed a safety due to the flag guarding penalty occurring in their own end zone. Two points are awarded to Team A, and it's Team A's ball at A's 30.\nIf Team B accepts the illegal forward pass penalty and Team A accepts the flag guarding penalty, then it's Team A's ball, replay down. This is a double foul (Rule 10-3-3C), so the penalties offset.","Jake Harvanchik","2023-01-15T12:24:28.000Z","2023-01-15T18:37:29.000Z",3,"20th","y7ih8r","Illegal Forward Pass, Flag Guard End Zone","NIRSA Flag & Touch Football Rules Book","Third and goal on B's 10.
