## Getting Started

### Node Modules

First and foremost, make sure to run `npm install` in the terminal in the root directory of this project. This will install all of the required dependencies and generate your **node_modules** folder. This step is very important.

## Project Styles

### Tailwind CSS

This project uses [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/ 'TailwindCSS'), a utility-first CSS framework. The required dependencies should already be included in this project. If you are missing the **node_modules** folder, simply run `npm install`, and it should generate with the dependencies specified in the **package.json** file.

### Tailwind Intellisense

To enable Tailwind CSS Intellisense, you'll need the VS Code extension. I suggest installing the [Tailwind CSS Extension Pack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=andrewmcodes.tailwindcss-extension-pack) which comes with a few extensions that all work together to make using Tailwind CSS a much better experience. To learn more about it, click the link above.

### Files

In the root folder of the project, there is an **assets/styles** folder. This houses the **tailwind.css** file. This file is used to eventually generate the fully compiled Tailwind CSS styles. Once compiled, it outputs the classes to the **styles.css** file, also located in the **assets/styles** folder.

### Just In Time Mode

This project uses a version of Tailwind CSS called [Just In Time (JIT)](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/just-in-time-mode 'Just In Time (JIT)') mode. Essentially, this means that our **styles.css** file will only include CSS classes that it finds in our HTML files in the root folder. This can be [disabled](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/just-in-time-mode#enabling-jit-mode 'disabled') in the **tailwind.config.js** file. By disabling this, Tailwind CSS will generate every single class it offers by default and you will make an extremely large CSS file, which is something we want to avoid.

## Working in Development

To work in a development environment, run the `dev` npm script. To do so, use either method outlined below.

- Run `npm run dev` in the root folder of the project.
- Use the NPM scripts shortcut in the [bottom left corner of the File Explorer tab in VS Code](https://imgur.com/a/pLlZvpk.png).

This will start a **long-running watch process** that will **generate** your styles **on-demand** instead of generating everything in advance. This is extremely useful for making development quicker and more efficient. In the terminal, you should see the initial compile message and the amount of time it took. Anytime you save an HTML file, the **tailwind.css** file, or the **tailwind.config.js** file, the CSS will be processed and re-compiled. These styles will not be minified in the development process.

Please note that classes are added on-demand, but not removed on-demand. This is currently by design as [stated by Adam Wathan](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/4098#issuecomment-821867583 'stated by Adam Wathan'), the creator of Tailwind CSS. To work around this (cache bust it), simply save the **tailwind.css** file. It will force a full re-compile and remove any unused classes.

To kill the watch process, put your focus in the terminal that the process is running it, and press `CTRL + C`. You should be prompted to confirm your termination of the process. Confirm your choice by entering `Y` followed by the `ENTER` key.

### Live Server

We will be using a VS Code extension to start our server up. Search for "Live Server" in the VS Code extensions tab. Alternatively, you can find it on the [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer).

Once you download and install the extension, you might see a [new button](https://imgur.com/a/KiUuKno.png) in the lower right-hand corner of the window in the blue ribbon. It says **Go Live**. When you click that, it should start the server and open it on your browser.

If you do not see the button, simply [right click](https://imgur.com/a/SR1f6sC.png) on the **index.html** file in the VS Code file explorer, and click **Open with Live Server**.

## Building for Production

Building for production is similar to building for development. Do either of the following to build the CSS for production.

- Run `npm run prod` in the root folder of the project.
- Execute `prod` in the NPM scripts shortcut located at the [bottom left of the File Explorer tab in VS Code](https://imgur.com/a/sXlKWwV.png).

Contrary to the development script we used before, this will **not** start a long-running watch process; rather, this script compiles the CSS once and only once. It will take only classes found in the HTML files located in the root folder and compile them into the **styles.css** file located in **assets/styles/styles.css**. These styles will be minified.

### Deploying the Project

This project uses [Gulp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp) to build the project for deployment. By running Gulp, it will create a **dist** folder in the root of your project. Gulp will then copy over all the necessary files from your project's source and assets into the **dist** folder.

In addition to that, Gulp will also optimize and minify the files as needed. The HTML, SVG, and JavaScript files will all be minified. Minifying a file simply means removing whitespace and other unnecessary characters/symbols. We do this to reduce the size of the files(s).

The styles (css) will be copied over to the dist as well. Since the css is already minified by Tailwind CLI's use of [PostCSS](https://postcss.org/) and the [JIT Engine](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/just-in-time-mode), we do not need to minify it here. It is **important** to first run `npm run prod` before running `gulp`. By not doing this, gulp will be using the non-minified version of your CSS.

The images will also be copied over as well and optimized using [gulp-image](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-image), an image optimizer. This will **only** optimize PNG, JPG, and GIF images. Nearly every other image type will be copied over, but not optimized, including PDF files.

### Using Gulp

So how do you use Gulp? It's very easy! Here are three options. 1) Open the [VS Code terminal](https://imgur.com/a/JbdX0if.png) and run the command `gulp`. This will execute the default task found in the **gulpfile.js** file in the root directory. The default task then executes, in order, all of the other tasks to build the project. 2) Alternatively, I have created an NPM script called `gulp`. You can run this from the [bottom left corner of the VS Code window in the NPM Scripts tab](https://imgur.com/a/3hGD00j.png). 3) If you do not see the NPM scripts tab, you may also [run this command in the terminal](https://imgur.com/a/Ucmbmtz.png) by running `npm run gulp`, but at that point, just typing `gulp` is easier.

### What if I Need a Different Output Folder Name?

In the case that you need to change the name of the output folder from **dist** to something else, simply navigate to the **gulpfile.js** file and find the variable `destination` [located near the top of the file](https://imgur.com/a/MqWSltR.png). By default, it is set to `dist`, but you may change this by replacing the `dist` part of the string to whatever you'd like. Another common destination folder name is `docs`, which is used for deploying a project to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
