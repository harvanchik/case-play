# The Case Play App

This web application houses sports case plays that are used for educational purposes.

## Finding a Case Play

As of right now, there is a home page that lists all of the case plays loaded in the database. You can find this home page at https://caseplay.org and click on a case play ID to navigate to that case play's page. From there, you can click the `copy url` button to share the case play with others.
